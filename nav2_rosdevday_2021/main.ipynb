    "Nav2 is a powerful tool that continues to get more powerful. We are able to navigate to poses, follow tracked dynamic obstacles, respect intermediary pose constraints, and execute tasks while following waypoints. Further, keepout and speed restricted zones make it possible to define regions of the map to have specialized behavior to influence freespace planning. These features, and many more, area available exclusively in ROS2 and Nav2.\n",
